# How to contribute to Berkeley Mobile

Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in our project? Here's a quick rundown!

## Starting development

1. Choose an issue  you are interested in addressing or a fethatature that you would like to add. **See TODOs in [README.md](README.md) to increase the chance of getting your contribution accepted.**
2. Fork the repository. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under `github-username/repository-name`.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`.
4. Create a new branch for the change using `git checkout -b branch-name`.
5. Make changes to your fork until you are ready to submit. Make sure to commit regularly to save and describe your work. Here are some useful commands:
* Use `git add changed-file-paths` to include the file in your patch.
* Use `git commit -m "A short message describing your changes"` to save your work and describe the changes.

## Submitting changes

1. Push your changes to the remote repository using `git push origin branch-name`.
2. Send a pull request from your fork's branch to our master branch
3. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change.
* For example, one issue might be called "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".
4. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer.
5. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by us.
6. Make changes to the pull request if the we recommend them.
